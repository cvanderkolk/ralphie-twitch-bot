# ralphie-twitch-bot

Hi 👋 This is a nodeJS bot for my husband [Ralph's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ralphiehardesty), which I built because I wanted an easy way to use channel point redemptions to trigger gifs/sounds onscreen via [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/). It lives in the cloud thanks to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

# FAQ

## What does it do?

- Allow users to redeem channel points to trigger gifs/sounds onscreen
- Allow mods in the channel to trigger the same gifs/sounds manually with `!gifboard` (e.g. `!gifboard Gagatrondra`)
- Power simple giveaways in chat

## Couldn't you use another tool?

Sure, but this is more fun 😁 One of these days I'll check out [Moobot](https://moo.bot/) or something.

## Can I use it for my own channel?

Go nuts 💃 Just make sure you replace any instances of the `ralphiehardesty` username with your own. I haven't gotten around to not hard coding it yet ;)

Questions? Comments? Suggestions? Feel free to create issues. I've done my best to document myself but I offer no guarentees as this is a fun side-project!
